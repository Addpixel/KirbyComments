## Installation

The recommended installation process is using the [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli).

```sh
$ kirby plugin:install Addpixel/KirbyComments
```

### Manuel Installation

1. Download [the latest release](https://github.com/Addpixel/KirbyCommentsPlugin/releases) as a zip-file.
2. Decompress the zip-file and rename the folder to “comments”.
3. Move the folder “comments” into site/plugins.

## Usage

The Kirby Comments plugin comes with an example snippet, `comments`, which lists all comments of a page and provides a form for submitting new ones.

To use the `comments` snippet, include it on the page where the comments and the comments form should appear.

```php
<div class="comments">
  <?php snippet('comments') ?>
</div>
```

You are not limited to using the `comments` snipped shipped with this plugin. Feel free to learn from [the source code](https://github.com/Addpixel/KirbyComments/blob/master/snippets/comments.php) and write your own comments-form if the `comments` snippet doesn’t suit your needs. Learn more about [writing custom comments markup](#custom-markup) and read the [API Documentation](#api-documentation).

## Options

Options may be set by calling `c::set('comments.OPTION_NAME', $value)` in your config.php.

```php
c::set('comments.use.email', true);
c::set('comments.email.to', array('my-email@address.com'));
```

## Email Notifications

To use email notifications enable the `use.email` option and specify **at least one recipient** using the `email.to` option.

The email body (email.template.txt) and subject (option: `email.subject`) **can contain placeholders** which will be replaced with the corresponding value. Placeholders have a name, start with `{{` and end with `}}`.

```
You’ve received a new comment on “{{ page.title }}” by {{ comment.user.name }}.
```

If you want to customize the contents of the email body, create a new file assets/plugins/comments/email.template.txt (create folders as needed). This location is based on [the recommended plugin assets location](https://getkirby.com/docs/developer-guide/plugins/assets#customizing-plugin-assets).

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `comment.user.name`| Name of the commentator. |
| `comment.user.email` | Email address of the commentator. |
| `comment.user.website` | Website address of the commentator. |
| `comment.message` | Message, that the commentator has posted. |
| `page.title` | Title of the page the comment was posted on. |
| `page.url` | URL of the page the comment was posted on. |

## Custom Markup

The Kirby Comments plugin ships with a simple `comments` snippet. It is designed to handle most use cases and to serve as example implementation. If you find yourself constrained by its markup or functionality, you can create a custom comments snippet.

### Basics

All comments are handled by the comments object. Kirby offers variables like `$site` and `$page` as an interface to its functionality. In the same way, the Kirby Comments plugin allows you to **access all of its functionality** by creating the `$comments` object based on a Kirby page.

```php
<?php $comments = new Comments($page) ?>
```

### File Structure

The `$page` is referring to the page holding the comments. Like this:

```
content/
└─ blog/
   └─ 1-hello-world/ <- $page
      ├─ post.txt
      └─ comments/
         ├─ comments.txt
         ├─ 1-comment-1/
         │  └─ comment.txt
         ├─ 2-comment-2/
         │  └─ comment.txt
         └─ 3-comment-3/
            └─ comment.txt
``` 

As you can see, the comments are simply stored as subpages, grouped in a hidden comments directory. The naming scheme of the comment directories was chosen to provide the following functionalities:

- `#-` makes the comments **visible** and **orders it**.
- `comment-#` gives the comment a **unique address**, at which it can be located. This means, that every comment has a public URL like: www.example.org/blog/hello-world/comments/comment-1. If you would like, you can create `comments` and `comment` templates to style them. By default, both the comments list (some-page/comments) and the comments individual pages (some-page/comments/comment-1) are not referenced by any link, so **no users will reach those pages**.

### Handling New Comments

OK, so you have created a `$comments` object. The first thing you should do is to **handle new comment requests**. This is done by calling the `process` method.

```php
<?php $status = $comments->process() ?>
```

This will do a lot for you. It checks, whether a new comment was submit to the page or if the user has requested a preview. For security reasons, the Kirby Comments plugin will check for a valid session key. Every time the comments form is rendered by PHP, the comments plugin generates a new session-id and stores it in a hidden input field.

```php
<input type="hidden"
       name="<?= $comments->sessionIdName() ?>"
       value="<?= $comments->sessionId() ?>">
```

You have to include this hidden field in you form. For every page refresh (including form submissions), a new session-id will be generated. This **ensures that no duplicated comment is submitted** to the page by refreshing the page after having submitted a comment and **prevents cross-site request forgery**.

In order to submit comments which are processable by the plugin, please respect the following guidelines.

1. Submit via POST (`<form ... method="post">`)
2. Submit as UTF-8 (`<form ... accept-charset="utf-8">`)
3. Do no chose the `name` in the markup, but in the plugin’s options. This means that code such as `<input type="submit" name="my-preview-button">` should be replaced by `<input type="submit" name="<?= $comments->previewName() ?>">`. This way, the plugin knows what names to look for. If you want to customize the name, register the new name in your config.php, like `c::set('comments.form.preview', 'my-preview-button');`. All available options are listed in the Options table above.
4. Hide the submit (not preview) button until the preview is valid. (`<?php if ($comments->validPreview()): ?><input type="submit" ...><?php endif ?>`)
5. Do not show any form when a user has successfully submitted a comment. You can check for that state by looking at `$comments->userHasSubmitted()`.

Before implementing your own form, have a look the default `comments` snippet in snippets/comments.php.

## API Documentation

### `$comments : Comments`

```php
$comments = new Comments($page);
```

#### `$comments->process() : CommentsStatus`

Processes the HTTP-POST data and creates new comments or generates preview comments. These comments are added to the list of comments contained by `$comments`.

#### `$comments->isEmpty() : bool`

Whether `$comments` contains any comments (preview comments included).

#### `$comments->nextCommentId() : integer`

All comments have a per-page unique id. The first comment has an id of 1, the second an id of 2, … This method returns the id of the next comment. The *next* comment is the *next after all stored comments*, so previewing a comment does not change this value as the preview comment is described by the next-comment-id.

#### `$comments->userHasSubmitted() : bool`

Whether the user has successfully submitted a new comment.

#### `$comments->value($name : string) : string`

This is a convenience method for creating forms. When a user submits a form, the page is reloaded and the form is cleared. In order to prevent this, you have to set the `value` attribute of all input fields to the value which was transmitted by the forms request. This method helps you in doing so, by returning an empty string, if the form was not submitted, or the value posted by the user.

```php
<input ... value="<?= $comments->value($comments->websiteName()) ?>">
```

#### `$comments->submitName() : string`

The HTTP-POST name for the submit button. The value is defined by the `form.submit` option.
